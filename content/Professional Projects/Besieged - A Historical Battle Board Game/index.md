# Overview

This is a board game that I developed in my first year of university with 2 friends, we developed it initially as an exercise in designing basic games. 

The game is designed for 2 people, each one having access to a castle and a mine. Each turn ends when either a player voluntary ends their turn, or they have no available moves left. 

# Win Condition

The main win condition is to capture the opponents keep. The secondary end condition is the timer, the average length of a game is about 30 minutes. If a game lasts more than 40, then the unit with the most gold reserves left and the most units alive wins. If both  

# The Turn 

The turn begins by taking in the income generated from the mines, with each miner active generates one gold coin. With the gold piece, a player can purchase units and place them in their keep. 

After purchasing the units, you can place them from the keep, onto the walls and into No Man's Land

# No Man's Land

This is the area between both castles, which a player's units must cross to get to their opponents castle to capture it. 

# Attack/Defense

Taking inspiration from _Risk_, the combat is very simple in _Besieged_ in that it comes down to a dice roll. Now, this can be swayed either way by unit abilities but it's rather simple. The larger dice roll wins the combat encounter and if the unit that wins is within range, they will destroy the losing unit.

# Units

There are a 3 main speciality units in _Besieged_: 

## Infantry

These units can attack another unit within one space of them, they are the cheapest unit at 1 gold piece at the start of the game and have a special ability called _Taunt_. _Taunt_ gives an infantry unit the ability to force an opponent unit to attack them rather than their selected target. 

## Archer

These units can attack an opponents unit within two spaces of them, and are the second cheapest unit at 3 gold pieces at the start of the game. They have a passive ability, that means that when they are attacking another unit that is greater than one unit away, they gain +1 to their dice roll result.

## Siege

These are purely defense units and cannot be moved beyond the castle walls. They can attack another unit within No Man's Land and are guaranteed to win the dice roll. However, at the start of the game, they cost 10 gold pieces and they take at least 1 turn to reload.
