This project is yet to be announced, but since it is my own project I'm more than happy and able to share about my involvement.

# Role: Lead Developer

In this personal project, I’ve taken on multiple roles, including programmer, designer, modeller, and project manager. Over the past year, I have been dedicated to creating a social deduction game set in Victorian London, inspired by titles like Among Us. As the sole developer, I’ve been responsible for building every aspect of the game, with a strong focus on technical implementation. This part-time passion project is something I work on during evenings and weekends, alongside my full-time responsibilities.

### Multiplayer Networking and EOS Integration
 Leveraging Unreal Engine’s networking framework, I have implemented robust multiplayer systems to ensure smooth, scalable online gameplay. By integrating Epic Online Services (EOS), I’ve facilitated cross-platform connectivity, allowing players to seamlessly transition between different devices.

### Modular Feature Development
My approach to development emphasizes creating modular systems. I designed the Inventory and Quest Systems as reusable modules, which can be adapted for future projects. This modularity not only makes development faster but also allows for easier iteration without disrupting core functionality.

### Version Control and Workflow Efficiency
 I set up a Perforce server on Digital Ocean for robust version control, streamlining the iterative development process. My workflow emphasizes efficiency, ensuring that each major feature starts with a scalable, generic solution, which reduces complexity in future updates.


## Self-Directed Project Management

As both the developer and project manager, I employed tools like ClickUp for task organization and Discord for collaboration and feedback management. This structured approach helped break the project into manageable milestones, significantly boosting my productivity and motivation. Past experiences taught me the importance of clear direction and meticulous planning, preventing the project from becoming overwhelming or stagnant.


# Outcome

Through this solo project, I have enhanced my expertise in networking, version control, and modular game design. More importantly, I gained valuable experience in managing all aspects of game development, from technical implementation to project planning. This journey has reinforced my ability to work autonomously, while also teaching me the importance of clear goals and structured workflows for long-term success. I cannot wait to see where this project goes.
