Hello, and welcome to my game development blog! As a Multiplayer Technical Designer, my work revolves around crafting immersive, networked experiences that bring players together. Here, I’ll be sharing insights from my journey, exploring the intersection of design and technical implementation within multiplayer games.

Whether you're interested in game design systems, optimising workflows with Unreal Engine, or tackling the complexities of multiplayer networking, this blog is a space to dive into the challenges and solutions I encounter daily. I’ll cover everything from designing gameplay systems for scalability to debugging multiplayer issues, with a focus on how design and technology come together to create engaging experiences.

Join me as I share tips, tutorials, and personal project updates, offering a glimpse into the world of multiplayer game development!

## Previous Experience
With several years of experience working in the game industry, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to a variety of exciting projects. My background includes:

### Ultix Technology
As a Gameplay Developer, I worked closely with designers and engineers to optimise workflows and ensure both single-player and multiplayer game modes were smooth and scalable. I focused heavily on Unreal Engine best practices and networking stability.

### Golden Tides 
During my time as an Unreal Engineer on Golden Tides, I tackled the complexities of multiplayer game development and learned valuable lessons in networking and collaborative workflows. Working with a team of talented engineers significantly expanded my skill set.

Throughout my career, I’ve focused on blending technical expertise with design intuition, ensuring that gameplay mechanics not only work but also deliver a cohesive and enjoyable player experience.

## Projects
Here’s a look at some of the projects I’ve been working on:

### Victorian Social Deduction Game (Unannounced)
A solo project I've been developing in my spare time, this game is a social deduction experience set in Victorian London. Drawing inspiration from games like Among Us, I’ve designed the game’s networking and gameplay systems entirely from scratch, leveraging Unreal Engine and Epic Online Services (EOS) for cross-platform multiplayer.


## Tutorials
If you're looking to sharpen your game development skills or delve deeper into the technical side of multiplayer design, check out my tutorials! I regularly create step-by-step guides based on real-world projects, designed to help you master both the creative and technical aspects of game development. Here are some of the tutorials you’ll find:

### Unreal Engine Multiplayer Basics
A guide to understanding how multiplayer works in Unreal Engine, covering topics like network replication, latency handling, and setting up basic multiplayer sessions.

### Building Modular Gameplay Systems
Learn how to design systems like inventories and quests that can be reused across multiple projects. This tutorial focuses on creating scalable, modular systems that can easily adapt to different games and genres.

### Debugging Networking Issues in Unreal Engine
Networking issues can be tough to tackle. In this guide, I cover common multiplayer bugs, how to use tools like Unreal Trace, and tips for resolving tricky networking problems efficiently.

These tutorials are designed for developers of all levels, whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your multiplayer game design skills. Be sure to check back regularly as I continue to add more guides and deep dives into the technical world of game development.
