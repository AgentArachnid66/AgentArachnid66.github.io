<p>The aim of this project was to produce a prototype AI horse that could respond to 3 parameters in a realistic manner. These were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus - Where you are looking and how hard you are looking at it</li>
<li>Ask - How much energy you are bringing into yourself</li>
<li>Neutral - How you are behaving around the horse</li>
</ul>
<p>These might not be the best definitions, but the more important component is how the horse should respond to these parameters</p>
<p>Focus should control where the horse goes towards, with ask managing how fast the horse goes. Neutral manages the horse&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>There were a variety of tasks that the player would be expected to undergo with the horse, modelled after realworld examples that I had the privilege of doing myself.</p>
<p>As the only developer on this, I aimed to make an AI that would be a general model of a horse&rsquo;s behaviour rather
than making a separate AI for each task, as this would have been more scalable for additional tasks.</p>
<p>This is a prototype project that is supposed to be a proof of concept, so the range of animations and assets was quite limited.
However, I think I accomplished a good starting point for the next developer to work on it.</p>
