      <description>This project is yet to be announced, but since it is my own project I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy and able to share about my involvement.&#xA;Role: Lead Developer In this personal project, I’ve taken on multiple roles, including programmer, designer, modeller, and project manager. Over the past year, I have been dedicated to creating a social deduction game set in Victorian London, inspired by titles like Among Us. As the sole developer, I’ve been responsible for building every aspect of the game, with a strong focus on technical implementation.</description>

      <description>Role: Unreal Engineer In my role as an Unreal Engineer for Golden Tides, I was tasked with designing and implementing code to meet both technical requirements and gameplay goals. A primary focus was ensuring that the code could scale effectively and maintain functionality within multiplayer environments. Although I had limited prior experience with networking in Unreal Engine, I embraced this challenge, growing significantly as a developer throughout the project.&#xA;Multiplayer Networking Despite being new to Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s networking systems at the start, I quickly adapted and implemented multiplayer features that supported seamless gameplay.</description>
