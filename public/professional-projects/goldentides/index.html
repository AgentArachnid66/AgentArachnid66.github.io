      <h1 id="role-unreal-engineer">Role: Unreal Engineer</h1>
<p>In my role as an Unreal Engineer for Golden Tides, I was tasked with designing and implementing code to meet both technical requirements and gameplay goals. A primary focus was ensuring that the code could scale effectively and maintain functionality within multiplayer environments. Although I had limited prior experience with networking in Unreal Engine, I embraced this challenge, growing significantly as a developer throughout the project.</p>
<h2 id="multiplayer-networking">Multiplayer Networking</h2>
<p>Despite being new to Unreal Engine&rsquo;s networking systems at the start, I quickly adapted and implemented multiplayer features that supported seamless gameplay. Collaborating with senior engineers helped refine my skills in this critical area.</p>
<h2 id="perforce-for-version-control">Perforce for Version Control</h2>
<p>Working within a large team environment, I utilized Perforce for version control, ensuring smooth collaboration across multiple engineers. This experience inspired me to set up my own Perforce server for future personal projects, significantly improving my understanding of version control systems.</p>
<h2 id="mentorship-and-collaboration">Mentorship and Collaboration</h2>
<p>A key takeaway from this project was the opportunity to work alongside highly skilled engineers who provided mentorship. Their guidance was pivotal in helping me navigate challenges, particularly in areas like Unreal Engine networking and optimization. The collaborative nature of the team fostered an environment where my problem-solving skills grew exponentially.</p>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
<p>My work on Golden Tides not only strengthened my expertise in Unreal Engine and multiplayer game development but also laid a foundation for more advanced networking projects. The experience broadened my technical skill set, instilled a deeper understanding of collaborative workflows, and empowered me to tackle future projects with confidence.</p>
